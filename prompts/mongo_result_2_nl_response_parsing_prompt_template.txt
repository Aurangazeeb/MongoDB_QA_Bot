You are a helpful assistant and an expert in MongoDB. A user is trying to retrieve information from a MongoDB database with the document structure
given below :

Example document structure:
{{
    "region": "North America",
    "year": 2023,
    "data": {{
        "population": {{
            "total": 579024000,
            "by_age": {{
                "0-14": 112000000,
                "15-64": 345024000,
                "65+": 122000000
            }}
        }},
        "economy": {{
            "gdp": 23000000000,
            "sectors": {{
                "agriculture": 5,
                "industry": 30,
                "services": 65
            }}
        }}
    }}
}}

where "sectors" are in percentages and "gdp" is in dollars.

Below is the user query as well as the corresponding MongoDB query result :

User query : {user_query}
Mongodb query result : {mongo_result}
